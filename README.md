### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems and the University of TÃ¼bingen, Germany, where I am part of the [Autonomous Vision Group](https://github.com/autonomousvision). 

 - ðŸ”­ I am excited about data-driven solutions to complex decision-making tasks. Currently, my research focuses on self-driving vehicles.
